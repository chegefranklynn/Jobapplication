Project Overview

Project Name: Job Application Automation System

Objective: To automate the process of job applications by scraping job listings, matching qualifications, and submitting applications, while optimizing for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

Key Features

1. Web Scraping:
   - Scrape job listings from specified company websites using PHP and Node.js.
   - Handle both static and dynamic websites using tools like Puppeteer.

2. Qualification Matching:
   - Compare job requirements with the user's resume.
   - Identify jobs for which the user is qualified.

3. ATS Optimization:
   - Tailor resumes and cover letters to include relevant keywords.
   - Ensure documents are formatted for ATS compatibility.

4. Automated Application Submission:
   - Submit applications for qualified jobs.
   - Handle form submissions and email applications.

5. Logging and Notifications:
   - Log all application activities and outcomes.
   - Notify the user of application status and errors.

Functional Requirements

1. Input/Output:
   - Input: User's resume, cover letter template, and list of target companies.
   - Output: Log file of applications, notifications of application status.

2. User Interface:
   - Command-line interface for running the script.
   - Configuration file for setting parameters (e.g., target companies, resume path).

3. Performance:
   - Efficiently process and apply to multiple job listings.
   - Handle large volumes of data with minimal latency.

Non-Functional Requirements

1. Scalability:
   - Support for adding more companies and job boards in the future.

2. Security:
   - Secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., login credentials).
   - Use environment variables for configuration.

3. Reliability:
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for network operations.

4. Maintainability:
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) for managing code changes.
   - Write clear documentation and comments in the code.

Technical Specifications

1. Technology Stack:
   - Bash: For automation scripting.
   - PHP: For web scraping and data processing.
   - Node.js: For handling dynamic websites with Puppeteer.
   - Libraries: 
     - Use Goutte or Symfony DomCrawler for web scraping.
     - Use Puppeteer for dynamic content handling.

2. Environment:
   - Linux-based system: For running bash scripts.
   - PHP 8.3+ and Node.js: For executing scripts.

3. Integration:
   - Email or Messaging API: For notifications (e.g., PHPMailer for SMTP, Twilio for SMS).

Milestones

1. Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
   - Set up the development environment.
   - Create initial bash script structure.

2. Phase 2: Web Scraping and Data Processing
   - Develop PHP and Node.js scripts for scraping and qualification matching.

3. Phase 3: ATS Optimization and Application Submission
   - Implement document optimization and application submission logic.

4. Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
   - Test the entire workflow in a simulated environment.
   - Deploy the system for real-world use.

5. Phase 5: Monitoring and Feedback
   - Monitor application outcomes and gather user feedback.
   - Iterate and improve the system based on feedback.

Risks and Mitigations

1. Risk: Changes in website structure affecting scraping.
   - Mitigation: Regularly update scraping scripts and use robust parsing techniques.

2. Risk: ATS rejection due to formatting issues.
   - Mitigation: Test document formats with multiple ATS systems.

3. Risk: Data privacy concerns.
   - Mitigation: Use secure storage and transmission methods for sensitive data.
