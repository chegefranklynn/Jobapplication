## Overview

The Job Application Automation System is designed to streamline the process of applying for jobs. It automates tasks such as scraping job listings, matching qualifications, and optimizing resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Collect job listings from websites using both static and dynamic scraping techniques.
- **Qualification Matching**: Compare job requirements with your resume.
- **ATS Optimization**: Tailor resumes and cover letters for ATS compatibility.
- **Automated Application Submission**: Submit applications for qualified jobs.
- **Logging and Notifications**: Track application activities and receive updates.

## Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating scraper instances dynamically.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Applied for qualification matching and ATS optimization.
- **Observer Pattern**: Utilized for logging and notifications.
- **Template Method Pattern**: Defines a standard workflow for scraping.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Enhances scraper functionality with features like caching and error handling.
